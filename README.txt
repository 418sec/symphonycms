[INSTALLATION]

** See further down for updating instructions **

1. This step assumes you downloaded a zip archive from the Symphony accounts 
   site (http://accounts.symphony21.com). Upload the following files and 
   directories to the root directory of your website:

     - index.php
     - install.php
     - /symphony
     - /workspace
     - /extensions

   (Alternatively, you can upload the .zip archive to the same location and
   run 'unzip' from the command line.)
	
   Note: You can leave /workspace out if you do not want the default theme.

2. Point your web browser at http://yourwebsite.com/install.php and provide
   details for establishing a database connection and about your server
   environment.

3. Celebrate!



[UPDATING]

1. Backup /symphony/.htaccess

2. Replace /symphony, update.php & index.php with those contained 
   in this archive.

3. Put the backed up .htaccess file into the new /symphony folder

4. If necessary, run the following SQL ensuring to change tbl_ to 
   match your table prefix. This will get your database up to date.
